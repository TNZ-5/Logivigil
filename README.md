## Technologies Used

The project utilizes the following technologies:

- **IntelliJ IDEA:** IntelliJ IDEA is an IDE for Java development. It is used to write, debug, and test Java code. IntelliJ IDEA also provides a number of features that make it easier to develop Spring applications, such as code completion, refactoring, and debugging.
  
- **Java:** Java is a programming language that is used to develop a wide variety of applications, including web applications, mobile applications, and enterprise applications. Java is a popular choice for developing log management applications because it is platform-independent, scalable, and secure.
  
- **Spring:** Spring is a popular framework for developing Java applications. It provides a number of features that make it easier to develop modular, scalable, and reusable applications. Spring is a good choice for developing log management applications because it provides a number of features that are specifically designed for managing logs, such as logging abstraction, log routing, and log aggregation.

In addition to these three main technologies, LogiVigil also uses a number of other technologies, such as:

- **Tomcat:** Tomcat is an open-source web application server that is used to deploy and run Java web applications.
  
- **Postman:** Postman is a popular tool for testing APIs. It can be used to send HTTP requests to LogiVigil and view the response.
